# Chisel
A lightweight responsive framework.

## Goals:
- Rely on CSS as much as possible
	+ Use dry selectors as much as possible
- Completely prevent FOUC
- Code that is unique to the page should stay in the page's markup via data attributes or classes (if its not reusable for another page)
- Rely on JS as little as possible
	+ JS should only be used to activate CSS classes and for event handling
- Keep markup as symantic and short as possible
- No dependencies on outside libraries or other modules or baked-in hooks
- Never use images for UI

## To-Do:
### High
- pull banner from package.json
- flex video
- form validation: js
